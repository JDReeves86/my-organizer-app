# My Organizer App

A React app designed to help keep you organized and up to date with all the things you need to do. This is very much a work in progress, and functionality will be added over time. Initial use will allow you to take and save notes, create to-do lists, and set dates for to-do's.

Future plans include a simple calendar app that will sync with your to-dos. 

## I'm coming for you Microsoft!
